Basic Installation
==================
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

Optional Features
=================
By default a single-threaded version of the executable is built, which
is fine for machines with a single processor core. If the machine the software
will run on has multiple processors, you might prefer to take advantage
of parallel processing by enabling multi-threading. For this you must run
configure with the --enable-threads option:

     ./configure --enable-threads

This will allow the program to run with up to 16 simultaneous threads
(tasks), at the expense of a small overhead and a slightly higher memory
usage. If your machine has more than 16 processors, say, 40 (!),
you may increase the maximum number of threads allowed by using instead

     ./configure --enable-threads=40

The configure script will try by default to link the code with the PLPlot
library ( http://www.plplot.org ). PLPlot is used to produce all the
diagnostic plots during processing (the so-called "CHECKPLOTs"). It is
however by no means mandatory, and may be deactivated with

     ./configure --without-plplot

Alternatively, it might be necessary to link PLPlot may from some unusual
directory <plplotdir>. Use in that case:

     ./configure --with-plplot=<plplotdir>

SCAMP requires the "aclient" executable from the CDSclient package
(get it from http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html).
If aclient is not in your PATH, you can specify an alternative path (including
the executable filename) with

     ./configure --with-cdsclient_exec=<aclient_exec>

SCAMP is dynamically linked by default. Static-linking generally leads to
faster (but fatter) executables. To enable it, configure with

./configure --enable-static

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for variables by setting
them in the environment.  You can do that on the command line like this:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix


Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
